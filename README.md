# General-NPuzzle-Solver

## Introduction
This project implements a general solver for the classic N-Puzzle problem (e.g., 8-puzzle or 15-puzzle) using three search algorithms: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* Search with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* Search with the Manhattan Distance heuristic.

The solver is written in Python 3 and supports customizable puzzle dimensions (N Ã— N). The program automatically generates or accepts user-defined puzzle configurations, performs state-space search, and outputs the optimal solution path along with experimental statistics.

## Running the code

You can run the code with: 
```
python main.py
```

### Program Interaction Example

```
Welcome to the N-Puzzle Solver!
Enter the puzzle dimension N (e.g., 3 for 8-puzzle, 4 for 15-puzzle): 3
Type '1' to use a randomly generated 8-puzzle, or '2' to create your own: 2
Enter the puzzle numbers (0 for blank), 3 numbers per row, row by row:
Enter row 1: 1 6 7
Enter row 2: 5__ 3
Enter row 3: 4 8 2
```

### Output Example
